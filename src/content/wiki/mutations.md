#### Mutations

Mutations are a PGM feature which may be used to modify elements of a single match. Some examples of a mutation are the Armor mutation, which gives players diamond armor, and the Health mutation, which gives players 10 extra hearts of health. Mutations only last for a single match, and may be enabled or disabled by staff members. Mutations can also be enabled through the use of a Mutation Token, which will create a poll for players to vote and decide whether or not to add a specific Mutation.

#### List of Mutations

Below are a full list of mutations currently usable on Stratus

#### Kit-based mutations

This section lists mutations which are granted through kits.

- Armor
    - The Armor mutation grants player full diamond armor and a diamond sword. Pack a punch!
- Boat
    - The Boat mutation, well gives you a boat. Do whatever floats your boat.
- Bread
    - The Bread mutation is a meme come to life. This mutation grants players various breads. It, however, knows and punishes players for switching teams - donators beware. After switching teams, the bread given is a lot weaker as compared to those given to loyal players.
- Elytra
    - As the name suggests, the mutation grants the use of the Elytra. However, due to the nature of majority of the maps, the Elytra cannot be used effectively as maps are not built with sufficient elevation. Thus, this mutation is usually used in conjunction with the Jump mutation.
- Enchantment
    - The Enchantment mutation gives different enchants to almost everything in your inventory, inclding tools, armor, weapons and bows. These enchantments are applied with different levels of enchantment.
- Equestrian
    - The Equestrian mutation, like its name suggests, grants players the ability to traverse the map in their own horse! Players are given a spawn egg for their own horse, and each horse spawns with randomly provisioned armor.
- Explosive
    - The explosive mutation grants player kits containing TNT, flame bows and more. During this mutation, TNT explosions have a randomised radius.
- Glow
    - The Glow mutation allows you to see players(teammates and enemies) through walls.
- Hardcore
    - The Hardcore mutation features a similar playstyle to that of the Hardcore mode in vanilla. Throughout this mutation, no natural regeneration can occur. Regenerations from kill kits, woolroom items, however, are allowed. It is usually used in conjunction with the Blitz mutation.
- Health
    - The Health mutation grants player double their health, from 10 to 20 hearts. Each kill rewards players a golden apple.
- Jump
    - The Jump mutation applies greater velocities to the player, thus allowing features such as double jumps, which are otherwise not possible in normal versions of the map.
- Mobs
    - The Mob mutation grants players spawn eggs to spawn random mobs.
- NoFall
    - As the name suggests, the NoFall mutation disables fall damage.
- Potion
    - The Potion mutation grants players with various potions to use on their victims or their team, ranging from negative effects like Poison and Blindness to positive effects like Speed and Strength. Use it to annoy your victims or help your team turn the tides in their favor.
- Projectile
    - The Projectile mutation applies different effects to projectiles, such as snowballs and arrows. When players are hit with the projectiles, the projectiles apply various negative effects to the victim, such as Weakness, Levitation(it's annoying!) and much more. Furthermore, the projectile also features various enchantment on bows, such as Flame and Punch.
- Stealth
    - The Stealth mutation grants player permanent invisibility. Stealth mode activate!
- Tools
    - The Tools mutation grants players random enchantment on their tools, pickaxes, shovels, etc. These enchantments are given with an amplifier of 3.

#### Targetable mutations

This mutation lists mutations which victimizes players.

- Apocalypse
    - The Apocalypse mutation.. Run from the zombies! Players are given random spawn eggs to these menacing creatures, ranging from Ghasts to Blazes. You may even see some of them stacked up. Of course, chaos ensues.
- Bomber
    - "Rocket barrage incoming!" The Bomber mutation features dropping TNT, and reigning(and raining) terror on the players. Run and hide while you can!

#### Other mutations

This mutation lists uncategorized mutations.

- Blitz
    - The Blitz mutation presents a new way to play the matches in the server. This mutation allows features limited lives assigned per player, which is usually between 1 to 3. Occasionally(25% chance), it may also limit lives per team(usually until all players in the team died, thus giving 1 live per player).
- Rage
    - The Rage mutation allows for one hit kills with a predefined kit, usually a sword and a bow. A player dies instantly when hit by these weapons.
