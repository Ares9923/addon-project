Junior Moderators are a group of staff members together with Moderators and Senior Moderators that enforce the rules and maintain a friendly atmosphere. They represent the order of the community, are expected to uphold the rules and assist players. This rank is the first step in the path of moderation, and is a trial to be accustomed to the inner workings of the staff team and handling of the authority given.

#### Description

A moderator's primary task is to uphold and enforce order in the server by ensuring that the rules are followed. They punish those who break them, and help keep the server, both in Minecraft and in Discord, a friendly place by upholding the rules.

#### Requirements

Next to the basic requirements of maintaining order and enforcing rules, a moderator is the voice of the community to the staff, and it is  important that moderators are mature, fair and approachable. Moderators must adhere to the staff code of conduct. A moderator must also be able to commit to spending a fair amount of time in-game, as well as staying updated regarding the status quo of Stratus. They must be fluent in English.
