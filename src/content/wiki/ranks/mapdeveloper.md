Map Developers are the staff members in charge of creating and managing maps. A Map developer is very knowledgeable in either building, [XML](xml), or both.

#### Description

Map developers manage everything in relation to maps. They look into map submissions on the github s[ubmission page](/https://github.com/StratusNetwork/Map-Rotations/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue), working with the submitter to decide whether a map will get into the repo or rotation. To make sure that maps work well, map devs test submitted maps on their map-dev server. Users can always ask map devs for help if they need help with the XML for their map. They are in charge of making sure that maps work to their optimal functionality, and are the ones who are in change of fixing broken maps. They also manage the docs page.
